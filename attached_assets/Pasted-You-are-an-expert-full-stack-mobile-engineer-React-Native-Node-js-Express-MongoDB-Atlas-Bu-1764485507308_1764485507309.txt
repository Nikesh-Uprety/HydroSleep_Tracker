You are an expert full-stack mobile engineer (React Native + Node.js/Express + MongoDB Atlas).  
Build a complete production-ready mobile app and backend API based on the detailed specs below.

================================
ROLE & GOAL
================================
Act as:
- Lead React Native engineer
- Backend API architect (Node.js/Express)
- MongoDB data model designer
- UX engineer

Goal:
- Build a **health & habit tracking app** (sleep + water + goals) whose UI/UX matches the described mockup.
- Implement a secure backend using **Node.js/Express** with **MongoDB Atlas** as the database.
- Provide clean, well-structured, and well-commented code, plus a short README with run instructions.

================================
TECH STACK
================================
Frontend:
- React Native with Expo (TypeScript preferred)
- React Navigation (stack + bottom tabs)
- Axios (or Fetch wrapper) for HTTP
- State: React Query or simple Context + hooks (your choice, but keep it simple and clear)
- No paid libraries

Backend:
- Node.js + Express (TypeScript or modern JS with ES modules)
- MongoDB Atlas using Mongoose ODM
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication
- bcrypt (or bcryptjs) for password hashing
- dotenv for environment variables
- Helmet + basic security middleware
- CORS enabled for the mobile app

Project structure:
- Two separate folders: `/mobile` and `/server`
- Each with its own package.json and README

================================
APP CONCEPT & MAIN FEATURES
================================
App name (placeholder): **HydroSleep Tracker**.

Key user capabilities:
1. Create an account and log in securely.
2. See a friendly **Dashboard** with cards for:
   - Water Intake
   - Sleep Tracker
   - Sleep Report
   - Goals
3. Track **sleep**:
   - View last night’s sleep duration.
   - See a detailed sleep report with:
     - Total sleep duration (e.g., “8h 05m”)
     - Percentages for Rested, REM, and Deep Sleep
     - Suggestion text.
4. Track **water intake**:
   - Log daily water consumption (e.g., in liters or ml).
   - See a weekly bar chart with 7 days and a banner “7 Day Goal Met!” when goal is reached.
5. Manage **daily goals**:
   - Exercise regularly (# times/week)
   - Drink water (L per day)
   - Improve sleep (hours/night)
   - Show them in a simple list like:
       - Exercise Regularly – 4x
       - Drink Water – 3L
       - Improve Sleep – 8h
6. All data is stored per user in **MongoDB Atlas** (no shared data across users).

================================
UI / UX – MATCH THE MOCKUP
================================
Recreate the UI based on this description of the provided image:

1. **Login / Welcome Screen**
   - White background.
   - Large illustration at the top (person with a big glass of water – you can use any free vector or placeholder).
   - Title text: “Welcome Back!”
   - Fields:
     - Email (text input)
     - Password (password input)
   - Primary button: **Log In** (full-width, blue, rounded corners).
   - Under the button, small text: “Don’t have an account? Sign Up” with the Sign Up part tappable.
   - On success -> navigate to Dashboard.
   - Provide a separate **Sign Up** screen with fields: Name, Email, Password, Confirm Password.

2. **Dashboard Screen**
   - Title area at top:
     - “Dashboard”
     - Subtext: “Hello, [UserName]”
   - Below, vertical list of **card items**:
     - “Water Intake – Awesome Efforts”
     - “Sleep Tracker”
     - “Sleep Tracker” (you can treat the second one as “Sleep Report” if you want)
     - “Goals”
   - Each card:
     - Rounded white card with a small icon/illustration on left and a right arrow chevron on the right.
   - Bottom **tab bar** (4 tabs):
     - Home (Dashboard)
     - Water
     - Sleep
     - Goals
   - Tapping cards or tabs navigates to dedicated screens.

3. **Sleep Report Screen (Simple)**
   - Title: “Sleep Report” + subtitle “Last Night”.
   - Large card in the middle:
     - Illustration of a person sleeping.
     - Big time label: e.g., “7h 55m”.
     - Subtext: e.g., “Didn’t move in bed”.
   - Button at bottom of card: **Stop Tracking** (blue, rounded).
   - For functionality: treat sleep tracking as logging a completed sleep session (user can stop and save).

4. **Water Report Screen**
   - Title: “Water Report”.
   - Subtitle: “Week of [date]” (backend should send the start date of the displayed week).
   - Banner text: “7 Day Goal Met!” when weekly goal is achieved; otherwise something like “Keep Going”.
   - Display a simple **7-bar chart** representing daily water intake vs goal:
     - You can implement with a simple custom bar chart using `View` widths/heights (no need for heavy chart libraries).
   - Under the chart, a “Tips” section:
     - “The more you drink regularly, the better your hydration.” (example text from mockup).

5. **Sleep Report Screen (Detailed)**
   - Title: “Sleep Report – Last Night”.
   - Top: circular or badge-style illustration (medal or ribbon).
   - Text: “Great Job! 8h 05m”.
   - Row of three round stats under it:
     - “90% – Rested”
     - “25% – REM”
     - “20% – Deep Sleep”
   - Under that, “Suggestions” section:
     - Example text: “A consistent sleep schedule helps your body recover.”
   - Values should be pulled from backend data for last sleep entry (with some simple logic to compute percentages).

6. **Goals Screen**
   - Title: “Goals”.
   - Subtitle: “Daily”.
   - Simple list of goal rows:
     - “Exercise Regularly – 4x”
     - “Drink Water – 3L”
     - “Improve Sleep – 8h”
   - Each row:
     - Left: goal label.
     - Right: numeric/units in blue.
   - Tapping a row should open a simple modal or secondary screen to edit that goal.

Design guidelines:
- Clean, minimal, iOS-style.
- Primary color: a mid/bright blue (e.g., #2563EB or similar).
- Rounded corners for buttons and cards.
- Use system fonts (no custom paid fonts).
- Respect safe areas on modern devices.

================================
DATA MODEL (MONGODB + MONGOOSE)
================================
Design Mongoose schemas (at minimum):

1. **User**
   - _id: ObjectId
   - name: string (required)
   - email: string (required, unique, lowercase)
   - passwordHash: string (required, bcrypt hashed)
   - createdAt: Date (default now)
   - updatedAt: Date

2. **Goal**
   - _id: ObjectId
   - userId: ObjectId (ref User, required)
   - type: string enum ['exercise', 'water', 'sleep']
   - value: number (e.g., 4, 3, 8)
   - unit: string (e.g., 'times/week', 'L/day', 'hours/night')
   - createdAt, updatedAt

3. **SleepEntry**
   - _id: ObjectId
   - userId: ObjectId (ref User, required)
   - date: Date (the night’s date)
   - durationMinutes: number
   - restedPercent: number (0–100)
   - remPercent: number (0–100)
   - deepSleepPercent: number (0–100)
   - notes: string (optional)
   - createdAt, updatedAt

4. **WaterLog**
   - _id: ObjectId
   - userId: ObjectId (ref User, required)
   - date: Date (only date portion matters)
   - amountMl: number
   - createdAt, updatedAt

Backend should be structured so it’s easy to extend.

================================
API DESIGN (JWT PROTECTED)
================================
Base URL example: `http://localhost:4000/api`

Authentication:
- `POST /auth/register`
  - Body: { name, email, password }
  - Validate email uniqueness, hash password with bcrypt.
  - Return: { user: {id, name, email}, token }

- `POST /auth/login`
  - Body: { email, password }
  - Verify credentials.
  - Return: { user: {id, name, email}, token }

- Use JWT in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for all other endpoints.

Goals:
- `GET /goals` – return current goals for the logged-in user (three goals by default).
- `PUT /goals/:type` – update a specific goal (exercise, water, or sleep).

Sleep:
- `GET /sleep/latest` – returns the most recent SleepEntry and a human-friendly suggestion.
- `GET /sleep/week?start=<ISO>` – returns list for a 7-day range.
- `POST /sleep`
  - Body: { date, durationMinutes, restedPercent, remPercent, deepSleepPercent, notes? }
- `PUT /sleep/:id`
- `DELETE /sleep/:id` (optional).

Water:
- `GET /water/week?start=<ISO>` – return 7 days of water totals & whether 7-day goal is met.
- `POST /water`
  - Body: { date, amountMl }

Dashboard summary:
- `GET /dashboard/summary`
  - Returns combined info for dashboard:
    - userName
    - today’s water vs goal, and whether 7-day goal met
    - last night sleep duration & percentages
    - current goals

================================
FRONTEND LOGIC & FLOWS
================================
Authentication flow:
- If no token -> show Auth stack (Login + Sign Up).
- After successful login/register -> save token securely (for now AsyncStorage is OK) and switch to App stack.
- Auto-login if token exists and is valid (simple check).

Navigation:
- Use React Navigation with:
  - AuthStack: LoginScreen, SignUpScreen
  - AppStack:
    - BottomTabNavigator: Home, Water, Sleep, Goals
    - Each tab has its main screen (Dashboard, WaterReport, SleepReport, Goals).
    - Optionally extra screens (e.g., EditGoalScreen) accessible via stack navigation.

Data fetching:
- On Dashboard load, call `/dashboard/summary`.
- On Water tab, call `/water/week`.
- On Sleep tab:
  - Show both the simple card (7h 55m & Stop Tracking) and the detailed stats using `/sleep/latest`.
- On Goals tab, call `/goals` and display three goals.

UI behaviour:
- “Stop Tracking” button:
  - For now, open a small modal where user can enter:
    - Sleep start time, end time, or directly total hours and minutes.
  - On submit, call `POST /sleep`.

- Water logging:
  - Provide a simple “Add Water” button (e.g. +250ml / +500ml) somewhere on Water screen.
  - Updating the chart after logging.

- Goals editing:
  - Tap on a goal -> open a small modal with a numeric input to adjust value.
  - Save calls `PUT /goals/:type` and refresh data.

Error handling:
- Show friendly error toasts/alerts on network errors or validation errors.
- Validate inputs (non-empty email/password, positive numbers, etc.).

================================
NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
================================
- Use environment variables for:
  - Backend: `MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `PORT`.
  - Mobile: base API URL (for development can be a config file constant).
- Add simple logging (console or small logger).
- Backend must handle CORS for the mobile app origin.
- Add comments and JSDoc/TSDoc where helpful.
- Provide seed logic (optional):
  - On first user login, create default goals if none exist (exercise 4x/week, water 3L/day, sleep 8h/night).
