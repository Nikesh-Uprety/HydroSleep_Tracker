You already built the initial React Native + Expo + Node.js/Express + MongoDB Atlas app from my previous prompt (HydroSleep Tracker).

Now I want you to MODIFY and EXTEND the existing codebase with the following features, without breaking the current functionality.

================================
CONTEXT (EXISTING APP)
================================
- Tech stack:
  - Frontend: React Native with Expo, React Navigation, JWT auth, AsyncStorage token.
  - Backend: Node.js + Express + Mongoose + MongoDB Atlas, JWT auth.
- Current features:
  - Auth (register/login).
  - Dashboard with cards for Water Intake, Sleep Tracker/Report, and Goals.
  - Goals screen shows default goals: Exercise Regularly, Drink Water, Improve Sleep.
  - Sleep and Water tracking screens with weekly data and reports.

Do NOT regenerate the whole project from scratch.
Instead, UPDATE and EXTEND the existing mobile and server code.

================================
TASK 1 – ACCOUNT / PROFILE SCREEN + LOGOUT
================================

FRONTEND
1. Add a new **Account / Profile screen**:
   - Accessible either as:
     - A new tab in the bottom tab bar named “Account”, OR
     - A profile/user icon button in the top-right of the main Dashboard that navigates to the Account screen.
   - On this screen show:
     - User profile image (avatar).
     - Username / display name.
     - Email.
     - Buttons or editable inputs to:
       - Change profile image.
       - Edit username.
       - Edit email.
       - Change password.
       - Log out.

2. **Profile image handling**:
   - Allow the user to pick an image from the device library (use Expo ImagePicker or similar).
   - Show the chosen image in a circular avatar component.
   - On save, upload the image (or its URL / base64 string) to the backend via a dedicated API endpoint and store the reference in MongoDB.

3. **Edit username & email**:
   - Provide a simple form with validation.
   - When the user taps “Save changes”, call the backend update endpoint.
   - On success, update local state and show a confirmation message.

4. **Change password**:
   - Provide inputs:
     - Current password.
     - New password.
     - Confirm new password.
   - Call backend change-password endpoint.
   - Handle error states (wrong current password, password too short, etc).

5. **Logout button**:
   - Add a prominent “Log Out” button on the Account screen.
   - On tap:
     - Clear the JWT token from AsyncStorage (or the storage mechanism currently used).
     - Clear any user-related state.
     - Navigate back to the Auth stack (Login screen).

BACKEND
1. Update the **User model** to support profile data:
   - Add fields such as:
     - `profileImageUrl: string` (optional).
     - `displayName: string` (can default to the name used at registration).
   - Ensure the schema has timestamps.

2. Add new **user profile routes** (JWT protected):
   - `GET /user/me`
     - Returns the logged-in user’s profile: { id, name/displayName, email, profileImageUrl, createdAt }.
   - `PUT /user/me`
     - Allows updating `displayName` and `email` (with validation and uniqueness check for email).
   - `PUT /user/me/password`
     - Body: { currentPassword, newPassword }.
     - Verify current password with bcrypt.
     - If correct, hash the new password and save.
   - `PUT /user/me/avatar`
     - Accepts an image URL or base64 string (whichever is easier for you to implement).
     - Saves it as `profileImageUrl` on the user document.

3. Make sure all these routes:
   - Require a valid JWT via auth middleware.
   - Return proper status codes and JSON error messages.

================================
TASK 2 – ENHANCED GOALS: ADD & REMOVE CUSTOM GOALS
================================

GOAL REQUIREMENTS
- Existing default goals:
  - Exercise Regularly – 4x
  - Drink Water – 3L
  - Improve Sleep – 8h
- New requirement: user can **add extra custom goals** and **remove non-default goals**.

BACKEND
1. Extend the **Goal model**:
   - Add fields:
     - `label: string` (e.g., “Meditate”, “Read a book”).
     - `isDefault: boolean` (true for the three system goals, false for user-created ones).
   - Existing enum `type` can still be used for special-case logic (exercise/water/sleep), but custom goals can have `type: 'custom'`.

2. Create/Update endpoints:
   - `GET /goals`
     - Returns all goals belonging to the user (both default and custom).
   - `POST /goals`
     - Create a new custom goal for the logged-in user.
     - Body example: { label, value, unit }.
     - Set `isDefault: false` and `type: 'custom'` for these.
   - `DELETE /goals/:id`
     - Allow deleting only non-default goals.
     - If `isDefault` is true, return an error or simply ignore deletion to protect the three base goals.
   - Update existing `PUT /goals/:type` or add `PUT /goals/:id` as necessary:
     - Allow updating values/units for both default and custom goals.

FRONTEND
1. **Goals screen UI update**:
   - List all goals (default + custom).
   - Default goals should be visually distinct or locked from deletion.
   - Add a button like “+ Add Goal”.
   - For each non-default goal, show a small “trash” or “remove” icon to delete it.

2. **Add Goal flow**:
   - Tapping “+ Add Goal” opens a modal or new screen with:
     - Goal name/label (text input).
     - Target value (number).
     - Unit (string, e.g., “min/day”, “pages/day”, “L/day”).
   - Validate fields and call `POST /goals`.
   - Refresh goals list after success.

3. **Remove Goal flow**:
   - Tapping the delete icon for a custom goal shows a confirmation dialog.
   - On confirm, call `DELETE /goals/:id`.
   - Refresh goals list after success.
   - Do NOT show delete option for `isDefault === true`.

================================
TASK 3 – NEW ANALYTICS DASHBOARD (GRAPH VIEW)
================================

Create a new **Analytics** or **Insights** screen that shows a modern graphical overview of the user’s stats.

FRONTEND
1. Add navigation:
   - Either:
     - Add a new tab called “Analytics” in the bottom tab navigator, OR
     - Add a “View Analytics” card/button on the main Dashboard that navigates to an Analytics screen.
   - Name the screen “Analytics” or “Insights”.

2. Analytics screen design:
   - Clean, modern layout with white background and cards.
   - Sections (example, adjust as needed based on data returned by backend):
     1. **Weekly Sleep Duration** – small line chart or area chart showing hours of sleep for the past 7 days.
     2. **Weekly Water Intake** – bar chart for last 7 days showing amount vs. goal.
     3. **Goal Progress Overview** – e.g., a donut/pie chart or a horizontal bar that shows percentage of days in the week where goals were met.
   - Use a lightweight chart solution:
     - You may use `react-native-svg` + custom charts, or a free library like `react-native-chart-kit` if compatible with Expo.
   - Each section should have a header and brief description underneath.

BACKEND
1. Add a new endpoint:
   - `GET /analytics/summary`
   - It should be JWT-protected and accept optional query params like `range=7d` (for now default to last 7 days).

2. The endpoint should return data structured for easy charting, for example:
   ```json
   {
     "sleep": {
       "days": ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"],
       "hours": [7.5, 6.0, 8.0, 7.0, 8.5, 7.8, 6.5],
       "average": 7.34
     },
     "water": {
       "days": ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"],
       "liters": [2.5, 3.0, 2.0, 3.2, 3.0, 2.8, 2.5],
       "dailyGoalLiters": 3,
       "goalMetCount": 4
     },
     "goals": {
       "totalGoals": 5,
       "completedToday": 3,
       "weeklyCompletionRatePercent": 72
     }
   }
Use SleepEntry and WaterLog collections to compute the last 7 days statistics per user.

Use Goals to determine completion rates (you can define a simple completion rule such as “met if actual >= goal”).

Perform all calculations server-side so the frontend only has to render graphs.

================================
GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
Integrate new features without breaking existing ones.

Keep code consistent with existing style (TypeScript/JavaScript, folder structure).

Add/update any necessary types/interfaces.

Add error handling and basic form validation on the frontend.

Update README(s) if needed to mention the new endpoints and screens.
